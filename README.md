## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No external sources were used. 


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I believe it's fair to say that this project was rather straightforward and easy to follow. Due to the amazing instructions, I was able to complete it in a breeze. The only part that I would say challenged me was when we had to write the snippet of code for the count score function ourselves. With that, I simply followed the visual outline of the logic behind it and because I am a visual learner, it made it much easier to follow and understand. Besides that, everything else was very smooth. However, when it came to Github, it is one of the few times I used it, something can go wrong easily. I downloaded the GitHub desktop however, my GitHub account wouldn't connect. What did I do? What almost any computer science student and engineer do, I googled it. I figured out my problem lay within where the application was saved. Easy fix. Besides these small challenges, this project was lovely to complete and quite rewarding. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

One of the biggest questions I have about web development is how to better the user experience on a website and what it entails. I have come across some amazing websites such as Headspace.com and the way one interacts with the website is so pleasing to the eye and very easy to navigate. I am also curious as to how the data on some websites is stored and or protected. A website or mobile application like Bank of America must have a very complex way of storing its data and information since it is so vital for a banking company. Lastly, simply some of the UX/Ui design behind some websites, how creativity can be incorporated into a website, and the technicality behind it. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on it, the first and foremost thing would be to change the UI/UX design and layout of the website. First, the fonts would match the theme of the game. In this case, I wanted the theme of a zombie apocalypse and it would only make sense that the title would be in a “zombie” font and the background to be a burning and destructed field, because of course, we're in an apocalypse. To match a theme and to have this interaction is vital for the purpose of the game. Of course, if anyone were to play it right now it would have no resemblance to a zombie apocalypse and quite frankly, it would cringe. However, by also adding more features maybe like a self-district button where the whole world just explodes or like a help button that gives you 2 repeats, and a scoreboard to compare your scores. Of course, I could go on and on about how I could make this a crazy cool zombie game but this is what I would add as of right now.
